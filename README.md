## SQL RUN in BigQuery and the results:
## Documentation of experience and reflections working on each platform (BigQuery, MongoDB Atlas, Redis Cloud):
I set up BigQuery through Google Console and created a project, dataset, and table. The setup was easy and smooth, and the interface was easy to read and use. Also, the query editor was easy to use because I could test SQL queries with no issues. It was a great experience, but I had problems finding the cost management when running queries in the query editor.
I set up MongoDB Atlas using the free-tier cluster, used google colab to send the fake dataset to Cloud.monngo.com, and named it Healthcaredabatase.patients. Visually, it was easy to see the fake data set under collections that can show data such as PatientID and age. Overall, the experience of using MongoDB Atlas was an easy experience of using.
I set up Redis Cloud using the free tier Redis instance. I used Redis CLI to connect to database. I implemented it with google colab to produce different results such as retrieving data for a patient. Overall, it was a good experience to use due to dashboard being easy to use but I think there should be a way to test queries on the free tier on the Redis Cloud site.
